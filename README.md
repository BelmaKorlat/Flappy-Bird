# Flappy-Bird
This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic Flappy Bird game using C# Windows Forms. The game utilizes a timer, keydown functions, and pictureboxes to create a fun and interactive gaming experience. The objective of the game is to control a bird and navigate it through a series of pipes. The game ends when the bird collides with a pipe.

## Features
- Gameplay: Use the spacebar key to control the bird's altitude. The bird moves upwards when the spacebar is pressed and gradually falls due to gravity.

- Pipes: Pipes are generated at regular intervals, and the player must navigate the bird through the gaps in the pipes to avoid collisions.

- Scoring: The game keeps track of your score, which increases every time you successfully navigate the bird through a set of pipes.

- Game Over: The game ends when the bird collides with a pipe or the screen boundaries.
